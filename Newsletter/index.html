		<p>The film Academy might as well sign, seal, and deliver Lady Gaga’s invitation to next year’s Oscars.
		The triple threat—nay, triple promise—has been a part of the best-actress conversation since A 
		Star Is Born hit the festival circuit, earning rave reviews for her performance as Ally, a struggling but gifted
		singer who can seamlessly transition between country rock and booty pop. But Lady Gaga is not just coming for one award. No:
		like a rage-fueled Andrew Garfield in The Social Network, she’s coming for everything. </p>
		<p>Per IndieWire, Warner Bros. has officially submitted three songs from A Star Is Born to the Academy
		for best original song, all of which are performed by and co-written by Gaga. The songs are: 
		“Shallow,” written by Gaga, Anthony Rossomando, Andrew Wyatt, and frequent collaborator Mark Ronson; 
		“Always Remember Us This Way,” written by Gaga, Hillary Lindsey, Natalie Hemby, and Lori McKenna; and “I’ll Never Love Again,
		” written by Gaga, Hemby, Lindsey, and Aaron Raitiere.</p>
		<p>The submissions kick off A Star Is Born’s official Oscar run, though this is just one core category in a multi-pronged strategy; 
		the studio is also likely eyeing best picture, best director, best actor, and best-supporting actor, among others. 
		This song choice also means that Gaga could potentially walk into the 2019 Oscars with multiple nominations under her belt, 
		if she lands one (likely) or two (also very possible)—or, dare we say, even three—best-original-song nods along with a best-actress nod. 
		The last two iterations of A Star Is Born both landed best-original-song nominations,
		and one of them also won the prize itself—so it would be incredibly shocking if this one didn’t land even one nomination.</p>

		<h4><center><p>Will ‘Black Panther’ earn more Oscar nominations than ‘The Dark Knight’?</p></h4></center>

		<p>It’s looking more and more like “Black Panther” will achieve a historic Oscar breakthrough for superhero movies.
		According to the combined predictions of thousands of Gold Derby users, it will be nominated for Best Picture. 
		That’s something “The Dark Knight” couldn’t manage to do 10 years ago. But will “Black Panther” beat “Dark Knight” 
		in total nominations? Christopher Nolan‘s 2008 Batman drama earned eight bids and won two.<p>
		<p>“The Dark Knight” wasn’t nominated for Best Picture despite achieving the rare combo of critical acclaim and box office success. That snub 
		was so controversial that the academy expanded that category to 10 nominees the very next year. But even though it was shunned from the top race, 
		“Dark Knight” was still nominated for Best Cinematography, Best Film Editing, Best Art Direction, Best Makeup, Best Sound Mixing and Best Visual
		Effects, and it won Best Supporting Actor (Heath Ledger, posthumously) and Best Sound Editing.</p>
		<p>As of this writing our odds say “Black Panther” will do better — slightly. We’re currently predicting nominations for the film in nine categories:
		Best Picture, Best Costume Design, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, Best Production Design, Best Score, Best Song, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing,
		and Best Visual Effects.</p>
		<p>But there’s a chance “Black Panther” could do even better than that. It’s on the bubble for nominations in five other races: 
		Best Director, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Cinematography, and Best Film Editing.</p>
		<p>If it manages nominations in all those categories too, that would bring its total for the year to 14, 
		tying the all-time record shared by “All About Eve” (1950), “Titanic” (1997) and “La La Land” (2016).
		That will be a tall order, but it’s not out of the realm of possibility.</p>
		<p>But will “Black Panther” actually win anything? As you might have noticed above, 
		the film is predicted to be nominated nine times, but we’re not ranking it first in any category. 
		It’s close, though, ranked second in six races. We could be underestimating it; technically audacious
		films with big budgets often clean up below the line even if they don’t win Best Picture.</p>

		<p>Imagine you bite into a fluffy pink tea cake, only to discover a center filled with pure,
		bitter chocolate. Feel its astringency spread across your tongue. Savor the duel of pleasure and pucker it brings.</p>
		<p>Now you have a sense of what it’s like to watch The Favourite, the latest acerbic confection from Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos, 
		writer/director of movies like The Lobster, The Killing of a Sacred Deer, and Dogtooth. Lanthimos has always been a divisive filmmaker —
		his brand of chilly, brutally funny savagery can be a bit much for some audiences — and The Favourite will not break that trend, though 
		it’s more accessible than his previous films, with a screenplay by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara.</p>
		<p>It’s sort of a period film, about palace intrigue in the court of Britain’s Queen Anne 
		(who ruled from 1702 to 1714), though certain elements of its mise-en-scène almost certainly never appeared in 
		any royal court at the turn of the 18th century, let alone an English one. (Let’s just say it boasts one of the year’s best dance scenes.)</p>
		<p>Anne was queen when the Acts of Union were signed and England and Scotland were united to form Great Britain. 
		She also ruled during the War of the Spanish Succession, and waged war with France in North America for control of the continent,
		in what would become known as Queen Anne’s War.</p>
		<p>All of this is only vaguely in the background of The Favourite, though. 
		While characters fight about war and policy in the movie, I can’t honestly say I know 
		anything more about those elements of its history now than I did going in. And that is precisely by design:
		The Favourite is not a movie about history, but a movie that plucks some shadowy figures out of history and it uses 
		them to stage a devilish comedy of power struggles. In this movie, everything — flattery, friendship, feasts, companionship, 
		sex — is just part of a giant chess game to see who will hold the allegiance of the woman who helms an empire.</p>
